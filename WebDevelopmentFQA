1. The import javax.servlet can't be resolved

You need to add the Servlet API to your classpath. In Tomcat 6.0, this is in a JAR called servlet-api.jar in Tomcat's lib folder. You can either add a reference to that JAR to the project's classpath, or put a copy of the JAR in your Eclipse project and add it to the classpath from there.

If you want to leave the JAR in Tomcat's lib folder:

Right-click the project, click Properties.
Choose Java Build Path.
Click Add External JARs...
Browse to find servlet-api.jar and select it.
Click OK to update the build path.
Or, if you copy the JAR into your project:

Right-click the project, click Properties.
Choose Java Build Path.
Click Add JARs...
Find servlet-api.jar in your project and select it.
Click OK to update the build path.
